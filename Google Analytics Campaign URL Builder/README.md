# Google Analytics Campaign URL Builder

## About
Google Analytics users can add parameters to the destination URLS, or landing pages, used in their ad campaigns to collect additional information regarding the efficacy of the delivery channels used by their ad campaign and of the ad campaign overall. By example, you might run a Labor Day sale to promote deals at your online retail site. To promote that sale, you might set up an ad campaign to drive traffic to your site through multiple delivery channels such as various social apps, programmatic, email marketing, and direct display advertising deals with publishers. Running your ad campaign through these different channels would make it difficult to track the efficacy of any of these channels, which is important as you would want to optimize your ad campaign by shifting budgets to better performing channels. Alternatively, you could be running different versions of your ad creative or of the campaign targeting different users in different environments. By adding parameters to the destination URLS you set up in the AdTech platforms you've utilized, you can monitor campaign performance on a more intricate level to make more informed decisions. When a user clicks a referral link, the parameters you've added are collected in Google Analytics and the related data is availble to you in Campaigns reports.

This tool collects information from you on the five parameters that you can add to your campaign URLs and generates the assembled Campaign URL for you.
