# URI Encode / Decode

## About
I created this tool to encode and decode strings used as piggybacks on beacons fired through JavaScript and was intended as an aid in trafficking and managing beacons tied to digital marketing and web analytics. This is an extremely simple tool relying on decodeURIComponent() and encodeURIComponent() to encode and decode strings entered into the text field included in this tool.
